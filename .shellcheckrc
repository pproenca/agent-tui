# ShellCheck configuration for agent-tui
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Default shell dialect
shell=bash

# Disable specific checks:
# SC2154: False positive for trap 'exit_code=$?; ...; exit $exit_code' pattern
#         where the variable IS assigned within the trap string
# SC2329: False positive for cleanup() functions invoked via trap commands
disable=SC2154,SC2329

# Note: We intentionally do NOT enable require-variable-braces or
# quote-safe-variables as they are strict style preferences that
# create unnecessary noise. The codebase already follows good quoting practices.
