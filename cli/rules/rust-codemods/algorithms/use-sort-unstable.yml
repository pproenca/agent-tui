message: "Consider using sort_unstable() for faster sorting when equal element order doesn't matter"
note: |
  sort_unstable() is 10-30% faster because it doesn't preserve relative order of equal elements.

  Use sort_unstable() when:
  - Element order doesn't matter for equal elements
  - Performance is critical

  Keep sort() when:
  - You need stable sorting (preserving original order of equal elements)
  - Sorting structs where equal elements should maintain input order
rule:
  pattern: $VEC.sort()
fix: $VEC.sort_unstable()
