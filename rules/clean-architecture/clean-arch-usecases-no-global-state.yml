message: "Use cases should not access global state. Pass dependencies via constructor."
note: |
  Dependency Injection: Use cases should receive all dependencies through their constructor.
  Global state makes testing difficult and hides dependencies.
  - Replace lazy_static with constructor injection
  - Pass configuration as parameters
