message: "Consider using sort_unstable() for faster sorting when equal element order doesn't matter"
note: |
  sort_unstable() is 10-30% faster because it doesn't preserve relative order of equal elements.
  Only use sort() when you need stable sorting (preserving order of equal elements).
rule:
  pattern: $VEC.sort()
fix: $VEC.sort_unstable()
