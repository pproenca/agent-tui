message: "Vec::remove(0) is O(n), consider using VecDeque for frequent front removal"
note: |
  Removing from the front of a Vec requires shifting all remaining elements, making it O(n).
  If you frequently need to remove from the front, consider using VecDeque which provides O(1)
  pop_front() operation.
rule:
  pattern: $VEC.remove(0)
