message: "Use cloned() instead of map(|x| x.clone()) for cleaner code"
note: |
  cloned() is more idiomatic and concise than map(|x| x.clone()).
  It's specifically designed for iterators over references when you want to clone each element.
rule:
  pattern: $ITER.map(|$X| $X.clone())
fix: $ITER.cloned()
