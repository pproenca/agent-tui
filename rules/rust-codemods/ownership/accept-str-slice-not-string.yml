message: "Consider accepting &str instead of &String for more flexibility"
note: |
  Functions accepting &str can be called with &String, &str, or string literals.
  This makes the API more flexible without any runtime cost.

  Exception: Use &String when you specifically need String methods not available on str.
rule:
  kind: reference_type
  regex: "^&String$"
  inside:
    kind: parameter
    stopBy: end
