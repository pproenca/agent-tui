  default_prompt: "Use tui-explorer to discover bounded TUI navigation paths, generate schema v1 markdown acceptance tests, and verify them with fail-fast replay and artifacts. First, ask whether the user wants a live preview over the HTTP endpoint; if yes, start `agent-tui live start --open` before discovery and stop it with `agent-tui live stop` after verification."
